# Pong

This is a remake of one of the oldest arcade games around  using HTML5 canvas and js.  

‡‡‡‡‡ PLEASE NOTE:  To run in CLI, please enter "webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000" ‡‡‡‡‡

There were issues running on port 80 and 8080 on my PC, so I set the port to 8000 to avoid any conflicts.  Sorry for any inconvenience!

## How to play

Pretty straightforward stuff.  You try to move your paddle (the drumstick or phone booth) as to make contact with the ball (donut) and score on your opponent.  

### Controls
